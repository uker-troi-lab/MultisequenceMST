Components from MST (modified/extended):
- mst/ directory structure and core implementations
- mst/models/dino.py - DinoV2 classifier (extended for multi-sequence)
- mst/data/ - Dataset base classes (extended)
- Attention visualization approach (heavily modified)
- Duke dataset integration approach (heavily modified)

Our Main Contributions:
- Multi-sequence implementation for breast MRI classification
- Cross-validation framework with fold-based statistics
- Statistical analysis pipeline (DeLong's test with FDR correction)
- Training scripts and configuration management
